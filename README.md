# Code Refactor Starter Code
# 01 Challenge

## Description

Bootcamp week one challenge is an exercise that challenged my fresh skills as a developer. The skill sets utilized to complete this challenge included identifying areas of the code to improve, like consolidating css selectors and properties to follow HTML structure, writing a concise & descriptive heading and fixing broken links. Additionally,this professional README file was created to inform others of the purpose of this repository. I learned how to test my changes before saving them and to check my web page after each change to ensure I wasn't creating new problems by solving others. 

## Usage
This web page is fairly simple, but it does have some features you should know how to use. The main one is anchor links that allow users to drop down to certain sections from the navigation. 
[Here is an image showing how to use the anchor links in the navigation](/assets/images/01-challenge-screenshot.png)

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
